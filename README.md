# README
This is the reproducibility archive for the paper "NAME" (preprint: [https://psyarxiv.com/](https://psyarxiv.com/)). It allows one to reproduce all analyses and results in the paper.


### Folders
- `/Data` contains the raw EMA data and all processed data files created by data processing files. Note that the raw and processed data is not contained in the publicly shared repository at this moment in time.

- `/figures` contains the figures created by the below scripts.

- `/files` contains model fit objects generated by fitting `ctsem` models. Not shared publicly at this time

- `/analysis_ctsem` contains scripts relating to running CT-VAR models in `ctsem`, analysing and visualizing the results. Caution: running ctsem models using MCMC estimation can be time-intensive

- `/analysis_ctsem_subset` contains scripts relating to fitting CT-VAR models on the "short" and "long/EMA" datasets in `ctsem`, analysing and visualizing the results. Caution: running ctsem models using MCMC estimation can be time-intensive


### Scripts

- `aux_Functions.R` contains auxiliary functions for plotting, computing descriptives and processing the data 
- `analysis_descriptives.R` a script to compute the analyses presented as "descriptive statistics" in the manuscript, including: numbers of observations, within-person mean and variability, number of high risk responses. Does not include any analyses related to the modal response

- `analysis_variability.R` script which computes the modal response, and the "p_mode", the number of observations which are equal to the modal response. Also contains code for all the analyses described under the section "Variability as a function of the time-interval", including code to reproduce Figure 2.

- `data_processing.R` creates the processed data files using in the continuous-time model analysis, stored in `/Data`

- `analysis_msm.R` code to run and visualize the results of the markov-switching models

### analysis_ctsem
 - `analysis_fitted_model.R` code to load the fitted model objects, check convergence, extract fixed effect estimates
TBD


### analysis_ctsem_subset

 - `model_fitting_ema.R` fits the CT-VAR(1) model to the "EMA" data subset, saves in `/files`
 - `model_fitting_short.R` fits the CT-VAR(1) model to the "short" data subset, saves in `/files`
 - `analysis_fitted_models.R` code to load the fitted model objects, check convergence, extract fixed effect estimates
 - `plotting_ctsem.R` code to make additional visualizations of estimated model parameters, including lagged effect plots and impulse response functions (IRFs) for both data subsets. Caution: can be time-intensive to run this code.
